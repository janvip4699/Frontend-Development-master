    <h1>What is Pure Component? When to use Pure Component over Component?  </h1>
    <p>It is one of the most significant ways to optimize React applications. By using the pure component, there is no need for shouldComponentUpdate() Lifecycle Method as the ReactJS Pure Component Class compares the current state and props with new props and states to decide whether the component should re-render or Not.</p> 
    <p>Use pure component over component when : State/Props should be an immutable object. State/Props should not have a hierarchy. You should call forceUpdate() when data changes</p>

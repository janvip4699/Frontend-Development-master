    <h1>What is Redux Thunk used for?</h1>
    <p>Redux Thunk is a middleware that allows you to write functions that can interact with the Redux store's dispatch and getState methods. It's commonly used for working with both synchronous and asynchronous logic outside of components.The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met.</p>

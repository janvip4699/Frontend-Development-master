    <h1>2. What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Containers are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain, pad, and align your content within a given device or viewport.</p>
    <p>There are three different bootstrap containers:</p>
    <p>.container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint<br>
        .container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints<br>
        .container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint</p>
    <p>default .container class is a responsive, fixed-width container, meaning its max-width changes at each breakpoint.</p>
    <p>Responsive containers allow you to specify a class that is 100% wide until the specified breakpoint is reached, after which we apply max-widths for each of the higher breakpoints. For example, .container-sm is 100% wide to start until the sm breakpoint is reached, where it will scale up with md, lg, xl, and xxl.</p>
    <p>.container-fluid for a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.</p>

    <h1>13. What is the function of the delete operator?</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The delete operator of js removes a property from an object. It does not take any parameters & it returns true if it removes a property.</p>
    <script>
        let emp = {
            firstName: "Raj",
            lastName: "Tank",
            salary: 50000
        }
        document.write(delete emp.salary);
        document.write(emp);
    </script>
    <p>It returned true because delete operator successfully attempts to delete the third property.</p>

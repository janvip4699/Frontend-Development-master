    <h1>5. What are undeclared and undefined variables?</h1>
    <p>Undeclared variables : It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or declared earlier using the var or const keyword.</p>
    <p>Undefined variables : It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value.</p>
    <script>
        function varCheck()
        {
            // 'use strict'; // It verifies that no undeclared variable is present in code.
            // J = "Janvi";

            let string;
            if(typeof(string) ==="undefined")
            {

        varCheck(); //It will give J is not defined because it is undeclared or undefined. for variable J. and for string it will give variable is undefined because no value is assigned to variable string.

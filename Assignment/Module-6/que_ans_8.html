    <h1>8.  What is === operator?</h1>
    <p>Javascript strict equality operator(===) is used to compare two operands and return true if both the value and type of operands are same. Since type conversion is not done, so even if the value stored in operands is the same but their type is different the operation will return false.</p>
    <script>
        let a=2;
        let b="2";
        let c=true;
        let d=null;
        let e=undefined;
        let f=4;
        let g= 4;
        let h="Janvi";
        let i="Janvi"
        console.log(a===b); //It returns false because both data type is different
        console.log(a===c); //It returns false because both data type is different
        console.log(d===e); //It returns false because both data type is different
        console.log(f===g); //It returns true because both are same
        console.log(h===i); //It returns true because both are same
